AngularJS photo album manager.  I use this application to teach
myself new AngularJS techniques.

Sample photos are here:  https://github.com/ae6rt/sample-photos.
Clone it and copy albums/ into this project's root directory.

The backend is Java/JAX-RS.  Start it using

   ./gradlew build run [-Daccess.logging]

Then point your browser to http://localhost:8080.
